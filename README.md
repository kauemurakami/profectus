My name is Kauê Murakami, studying systems analysis and development at IFTM.
I started in the world of programming in 2014, while doing math I was enchanted with automation and Arduino.
Found my passion in 2016, I left everything and went to study Information Systems, where I continued developing my skills in IOT and started to get closer to mobile programming.
Looking for new challenges I decided to move to a federal institute, where teaching is considered better, where I am so far.
I am currently 100% focused on Flutter and GetX, always trying to contribute with new tools and risking some PR for the package.
My latest creations were GetX Snippets, a vs-code extension that will make life easier for anyone who programs with Flutter using GetX as a complete state manager.
After that I took a risk going further and proposed an architectural pattern for using GetX, GetX Patttern.
At the same time I look for opportunities as a freelancer.
If you want to know me a little better or exchange an idea, you can find me on Linkedin.
